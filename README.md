# National-Taiwan-University-Internship
My work during the internship at NTU, Taiwan. 

Please read the "NTU_Internship_Report.pdf" in the repository for a detailed explanation.

The gravitational potential heatmap of a system of two point masses A and B, where B is translating on a circular trajectory centered at A. The change in potential due to movement of B can be seen in the animation(3zd6id.gif): https://github.com/ashwanirajan/National-Taiwan-University-Internship/blob/master/3zd6id.gif


The trajectory of particle A kept initially at the center of circular trajectory of particle B, moving under the influence of gravitational force field of particle B(3zd5yo.gif): https://github.com/ashwanirajan/National-Taiwan-University-Internship/blob/master/3zd5yo.gif


The code for animations have been added. The script used to generate the simulations have not been made public due to liscence issues. However, One can contact me in case of any queries.
